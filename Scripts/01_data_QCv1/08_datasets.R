#Dataset Curation 
#goal: makes 3 datasets for analysis 
#sum read index's
#sum and add weight measurement column
#harmonize column names across datasets

#Old: extract only data from relevant set numbers (we include all sets 1-16 in our analysis)
#this code has been moved to the bottom of script if needed later
